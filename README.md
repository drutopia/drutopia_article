News articles on Solidarity contain depth and functionality beyond what is found on a typical site. An article can be part of a larger campaign or associated with specific groups.  By relating an action to the article, the post now becomes a mobilizing opportunity for readers. An article can also be posted automatically to social media accounts including: Facebook, Mastodon, and Twitter.
